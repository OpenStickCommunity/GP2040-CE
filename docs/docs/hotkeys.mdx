## SOCD Up Priority

This hotkey changes the SOCD cleaning method to resolve to a neutral input (no input) on the X-axis, but prioritize the `Up` input on the Y-axis when both directions are pressed simultaneously. 

| 1st Input + 2nd Input |  Result |
|:---------------------:|:-------:|
|      Left + Right     | Neutral |
|      Right + Left     | Neutral |

|       Down + Up       |  Down  |

## SOCD Cleaning Off

This hotkey changes the SOCD cleaning method to not resolve any directional inputs on both the X-axis and Y-axis when both directions are pressed simultaneously. The controller will send both directional inputs. 

:::note

This cleaning mode is only available in XInput mode as PS3/DirectInput, PS4 and Nintendo Switch modes do not support setting SOCD Cleaning to Off and will default to Neutral SOCD Cleaning mode.

**Default**: <Hotkey buttons={["S2", "A1", "Right"]}/>

## Toggle 4-Way Joystick Mode

This hotkey will alter the behavior of the directional buttons such that only the cardinal directions will register as inputs and diagonal directions will be disabled and ignored.
