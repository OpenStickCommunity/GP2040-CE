## Legacy Devices

GP2040-CE builds for these devices have been deprecated due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The manufacturer already provides a custom build of GP2040-CE
- The device is no longer available for purchase
- The operation of the device running an updated GP2040-CE build cannot be verified by the development team

These builds remain available, however legacy devices are not supported by the GP2040-CE team.

Please ensure you have a backup of the original firmware and your settings before updating your device!
