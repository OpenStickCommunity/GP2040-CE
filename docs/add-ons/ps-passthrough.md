# PS Passthrough

![GP2040-CE Configurator - PS Passthrough](../assets/images/gpc-add-ons-ps-passthrough.png)

Enabling this add-on will allow you to use a licensed 3rd party device to authenticate off of.  This add-on requires that you have something like the ![USB Passthrough Board](https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/Hardware/tree/main/USB%20Passthrough%20Board) or a board with a USB passthrough port on it already.  If you have passthrough enabled you can turn off the above `PS4 Mode` add-on as the two will not work together.  Please also ensure that under the `Settings` section you have chosen PS4 mode and picked if you want the GP2040-CE unit to function as a controller or as a fightstick.
