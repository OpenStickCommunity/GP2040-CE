## Performance

Input latency is tested using the methodology outlined at [WydD's inputlag.science website](https://inputlag.science/controller/methodology), using the default 1000 Hz (1 ms) polling rate in the firmware.

| Version | Mode | Poll Rate | Min | Max | Avg | Stdev | % on time | %1f skip | %2f skip |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| v0.7.0 | All modes (except PS4) | 1 ms | 0.53 ms | 1.36 ms | 0.86 ms | 0.25 ms | 95.91% | 4.09% | 0% |
| v0.7.0 | PS4 Mode | 1 ms | 1.45 ms | 2.14 ms | 1.86 ms | 0.16 ms | 90.26% | 9.74% | 0% |
