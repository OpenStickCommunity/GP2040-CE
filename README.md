## Performance

Input latency is tested using the methodology outlined at [WydD's inputlag.science website](https://inputlag.science/controller/methodology), using the default 1000 Hz (1 ms) polling rate in the firmware.  You can read more about the setup we use to conduct latency testing [HERE](https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/Site/blob/main/latency_testing/README.md) if you are interested in testing for yourself or would just like to know more about the devices used to do the testing.
