|:---------------------:|:-------:|
|      Left + Right     | Neutral |

|       Down + Up       |  Down  |

## SOCD Cleaning Off

This hotkey changes the SOCD cleaning method to not resolve any directional inputs on both the X-axis and Y-axis when both directions are pressed simultaneously. The controller will send both directional inputs.
