![GP2040-CE Configurator - Display Configuration](../../assets/images/gpc-display-config.png)

- `Use Display` - Turns on/off the display module.
- `I2C Block` - The Pico I2C block that will be used. Set based on pins, refer to table on page.
- `SDA Pin` - The GPIO pin used for the I2C SDA channel.
- `SCL Pin` - The GPIO pin used for the I2C SCL channel.
- `I2C Address` - The I2C address of your device, defaults to the very commonly used `0x3C`.
- `I2C Speed` - Sets the speed of I2C communication. Common values are `100000` for standard, `400000` for fast and `800000` ludicrous speed.
- `Flip Display` - Allows you to flip or mirror the display in a variety of ways.
- `Invert Display` - Inverts the pixel colors, effectively giving you a negative image when enabled.
- `Button Layout (Left)` - Changes the onscreen layout for the left side of the display and stick.
- `Button Layout (Right)` - Changes the onscreen layout for the right side of the display and stick.
- `Splash Mode` - Enables or disables a splash screen displaying when the unit is turned on.
- `Splash Duration` - Sets the amount of time the splash screen displays for on boot.
- `Display Saver Timeout` - Will cause the display to turn off after the specified number of minutes. Pressing any input will cause the display to turn back on.
- `Choose File` - This will allow you to upload your own image to be used for the splash screen. It is recommend that you use a two color 128x64 image (or one that is sized appropriately for your display). Uploading any other type of image will result in a conversion and sizing of the image automatically. If the image is inverted upon upload, just check off the `Invert` box.
