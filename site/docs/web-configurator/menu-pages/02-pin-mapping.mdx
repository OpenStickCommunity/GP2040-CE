# Pin Mapping

![GP2040-CE Configurator - Pin Mapping](../../assets/images/gpc-pin-mapping.png)

Here you can remap the GP2040-CE buttons to different GPIO pins on the RP2040 chip. This can be used to simply remap buttons, or bypass a GPIO pin that may have issues on your device.
You can also configure profiles that will change the GPIO to GP2040-CE button mapping based on what profile you have set. You can change the profile number either using the Web Configurator or using a hotkey shortcut.
