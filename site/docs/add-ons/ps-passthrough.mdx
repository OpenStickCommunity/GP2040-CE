## Hardware Requirements

## Note
 
 If you have passthrough enabled you can turn off the above `PS4 Mode` add-on as the two will not work together.  Please also ensure that under the `Settings` section you have chosen PS4 mode and picked if you want the GP2040-CE unit to function as a controller or as a fightstick.
