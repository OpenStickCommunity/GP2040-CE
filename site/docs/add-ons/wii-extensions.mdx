Classic Controller support includes Classic, Classic Pro, and NES/SNES Mini Controllers.

Original Classic Controller L & R triggers are analog sensitive, where Pro triggers are not.

Due to an accessory hardware issue, Drum & DJ turntable controllers may require hot-swapping from a Nunchuk or Classic controller before being usable.
