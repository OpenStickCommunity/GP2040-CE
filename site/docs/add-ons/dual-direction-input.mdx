# Dual Directional Input

Purpose: This add-on is intended to allow additional digital buttons to be used for directional inputs with either the D-Pad, or the cardinal directions of the Left and Right analog joystick at maximum magnitude.

![GP2040-CE Configuration - Add-Ons Dual Directional Input](../assets/images/gpc-add-ons-dual-directional.png)

## Web Configurator Options

- `Dual Up Pin` - The GPIO pin used for the secondary Up direction.
- `Dual Down Pin` - The GPIO pin used for the secondary Down direction.
- `Dual Left Pin` - The GPIO pin used for the secondary Left direction.
- `Dual Right Pin` - The GPIO pin used for the secondary Right direction.
- `Dual D-Pad Mode` - Choose if this should act as an additional instance of a D-Pad, Left analog joystick, or Right analog joystick.
- `Combination Mode` - Choose how these direction inputs should be combined with gamepad directions.
- `Dual Directional 4-Way Joystick Mode` - Prevents diagonal inputs from being sent when enabled.

### Dual D-Pad Mode Values

- `D-PAD` for D-Pad mode.
- `Left Analog` for Left analog joystick mode.
- `Right Analog` for Right analog joystick mode.

### Combination Mode

- `Mixed` - Combines both the Gamepad directions and Dual Direction Input directions and allows for all 3 SOCD modes.
- `Gamepad` - Gamepad always takes over when pressed, otherwise Gamepad and Dual act independently.
- `Dual Directional` - Dual always takes over when pressed, otherwise Gamepad and Dual act independently.
- `None` - Gamepad input and dual directional act independently of each other.

## Hardware

### Requirements

Additional buttons are required for each of the additional directions desired for a minimum of one button and a maximum of 4 buttons.

### Installation

For each button, connect one side of the button to their respective GPIO pin as assigned in the Web Configurator. Connect the other side of the buttons to GND.

## Miscellaneous Notes

"Gamepad direction" refer to the directions that are mapped in `Web Configurator > Configuration > Pin Mapping` whereas "Dual Direction Input directions" refers to the directions set up within this add-on.
