# Dual Directional Input

Purpose: This add-on is intended to allow additional digital buttons to be used for directional inputs with either the D-Pad, or the cardinal directions of the Left and Right analog joystick at maximum magnitude.

## Web Configurator Options

- `Dual D-Pad Mode` - Choose if this should act as an additional instance of a D-Pad, Left analog joystick, or Right analog joystick.
- `Combination Mode` - Choose how these direction inputs should be combined with gamepad directions.
- `Dual Directional 4-Way Joystick Mode` - Prevents diagonal inputs from being sent when enabled.

The pin(s) are configured [on the core Pin Mapping page](../web-configurator/menu-pages/pin-mapping) by choosing the desired input direction for the selected pin.

### Dual D-Pad Mode Values

- `D-PAD` for D-Pad mode.
- `Left Analog` for Left analog joystick mode.
- `Right Analog` for Right analog joystick mode.

### Combination Mode

- `Mixed` - Combines both the Gamepad directions and Dual Direction Input directions and allows for all 3 SOCD modes.
- `Gamepad` - Gamepad always takes over when pressed, otherwise Gamepad and Dual act independently.
- `Dual Directional` - Dual always takes over when pressed, otherwise Gamepad and Dual act independently.
- `None` - Gamepad input and dual directional act independently of each other.

## Hardware

### Requirements

Additional buttons are required for each of the additional directions desired.

### Installation

For each button, connect one side of the button to their respective GPIO pin as assigned in the Web Configurator. Connect the other side of the buttons to GND.

## Miscellaneous Notes

"Gamepad direction" refers to the core directions ("Up"), whereas "Dual Direction Input directions" refers to the directions used by this add-on ("DDI Up").
