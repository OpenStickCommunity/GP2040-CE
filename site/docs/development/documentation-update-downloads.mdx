# Update Downloads Page

Adding a microcontroller board or device to the [Downloads](../downloads/download-page.mdx) page requires an update to the `docs/src/config/boards.tsx` file. The information required will depend on whether you are adding a microcontroller board or a controller.

| Key          | Value                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`       | The name of the device what will be listed on the Downloads page                                                 |
| `configName` | The name of the device that will be used to generate the .uf2 file and used to generate link to release firmware |
| `pinout`     | Link to the devices pinout diagram                                                                               |
| `website`    | Link to the website containing device information                                                                |
| `image`      | Absolute link to the asset used for device, change only `BoardName` to match file name in `docs/docs/assets/`    |
| `supported`  | (Microcontroller Board Only) Whether the device is currently supported by the project                            |
| `category`   | (Controller Only) The category classification following convention listed below                                  |
| `desc`       | Short description of the device and manufacturer to be displayed on Downloads page                               |

## Microcontroller Board

The template for microcontroller boards can be found in [Templates - Microcontroller Boards](..//development/templates.mdx#microcontroller-boards).

To add a microcontroller board to the download list, fill out the template with all of the information and add it to the array `boards['Microcontroller Boards']`. The order that the boards are listed determine the order that they appear on the page so note the following order of boards.

- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Raspberry Pi Pico W
- The rest of the microcontroller boards in alphabetical order

## Controllers

The template for controllers can be found in [Templates - Controllers](..//development/templates.mdx#controllers).

To add a controller to the download list, fill out the template with all of the information and add it to the array `boards['Controllers']`. The order of the controllers in this array should be alphabetical.

For categories, the convention is as follows.

- `official` - Official boards of the project
- `open` - Open source devices
- `closed` - Closed source devices
- `legacy` - Devices that are not or are no longer supported by the project
